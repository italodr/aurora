# Foundational Technologies

Aurora is built on [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/), a pluggable, react-based text editor used by Facebook. 

# The BaseEditor

The BaseEditor is a wrapper around Draft.js that you can use to modify and change the editor. [Source here.](https://github.com/tundra-code/aurora/blob/master/src/lib/editor/BaseEditor.js)
